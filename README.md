# NYPD-Civilian-Complaints
A data science project on complainant genders for the NYPD dataset using machine learning and statistical analysis.

This project is divided into two parts:

Part 1 entails using statistical analysis and data visualization to determine if NYPD discriminates against the complaint length based on the gender of the complainant.

Part 2 uses machine learning to classify complainant gender.
