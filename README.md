# NYPD-Civilian-Complaints

## About
This repository contains the code used for a project in Practice and Application of Data Science (DSC-80) course at UC San Diego during Spring 2021 under Professor Justin Eldridge. This project attempts to analyze NYC Civillian Complaints to determine the gender of the complainant.

This project is divided into two parts:

Part 1 entails using statistical analysis and data visualization to determine if NYPD discriminates against the complaint length based on the gender of the complainant.

Part 2 uses machine learning to classify complainant gender.
